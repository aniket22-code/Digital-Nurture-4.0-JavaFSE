Branching
Branching in Git allows you to create a separate line of development from any existing branch (commonly the main branch) and work in isolation so that changes donâ€™t affect the main codebase until merged.

Features:

Lets you explore and write code in isolation without affecting other branches.

Prevents chaos when multiple people work on the same repository.

Supports parallel development for features, bug fixes, and experiments.

Merging
Merging in Git is the process of combining changes from one branch into another, integrating both commit histories so that the target branch contains all updates from the source branch.
